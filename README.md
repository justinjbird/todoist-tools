# Todoist Tools

An incomplete set of tools to use with Todoist.

## Why?

I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) to manage my tasks...all my tasks. I manage tasks using [GTD framework](https://gettingthingsdone.com/). I wanted to create a set of tools to help me automate some of my tasks. Todoist has the concept of emailing tasks to a project, but it's pretty limited in it's use. I wanted to have more control over the tasks I create. I also wanted to understand how I could generate tasks for various aspects of Github like failed builds, issues, pull requests, discussions, etc.

## Uses

- [Todoist REST API](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#overview)

## Requirements

- You need your Todoist API token. You can find it [here](https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer).
- Create a repository secret called TODOIST_API_TOKEN, paste the token as the value.

## Tools

- [Create Task](./create-task.md) creates a task in Todoist.
